## 🎨 Design System

Fyrspit uses a dark-first design inspired by Letterboxd with:
- **Colors**: Dark gray backgrounds with teal (#00A6B5) accents and orange CTAs
- **Typography**: Inter font family for clean readability
- **Components**: Consistent card-based layouts with subtle borders and hover effects
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design that scales beautifully to desktop

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

- **Firestore Security Rules** restrict data access based on user authentication and privacy settings
- **Input Validation** with Zod schemas on both client and server
- **Rate Limiting** prevents spam and abuse
- **Privacy Controls** allow users to set flight visibility (public, friends, private)
